One morning my friend and I were thinking about how we could plan our summer break away from school
Driving from our own state to several nearby states would help to expand our limited funds
Inviting six other friends to accompany us would lower our car expenses 
Stopping at certain sites would also help us stretch our truly limited travel budget 
Yesterday I engaged in an interesting and enlightening discussion about finances
